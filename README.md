# fsevents_watcher
A python extension to gather filesystem events generated by the operating system (macOS) for a specific path.
Have a look at `macos_watcher.py` for an example.

## requirements
- homebrew (used to pull other requirements)
- xcode devutils
- golang (used to compile the go code)
- pkg-config (used to generate the header files)

## bootstrap
```
xcode-select --install  # installs xcode devutils
# make sure you have set your GOPATH
brew install pkg-config golang
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/nilleb
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nilleb
git clone https://github.com/nilleb/fsevents-watcher
cd fsevents-watcher
# which python do you use? we try to detect it in the set-python-home.sh.
# if you feel it's not the right version, feel free to edit it.
./build.sh

# now you can:
# - launch the example by typing
./launch.sh
# - if you want to use the included mtime_file_watcher.py for your AppEngine dev_appserver.py
sudo python replace_mtime_file_watcher.py replace
# now you can start `dev_appserver.py` as usual
# - if you want to restore the original mtime_file_watcher.py,
sudo python replace_mtime_file_watcher.py restore
```

## troubleshooting
### python version mismatch
```
Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
./launch.sh: line 4: 52141 Abort trap: 6           $PYTHON_HOME/bin/python macos_watcher.py
```
Execute a `otool -L fsevents_watcher.so` and verify that the python path is the one of the python executable you are using to launch the code.

### permission denied while replacing the mtime file watcher
`IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/devappserver2/mtime_file_watcher.py'`
Have you typed `sudo` before the `replace_mtime_file_watcher.py` invocation?

### gcloud components update
If you update the gcloud components, you shall re-replace the `mtime_file_watcher.py` again..
